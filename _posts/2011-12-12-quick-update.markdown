Sorry for the lack of blogging recently - I have been extremely busy over the last few weeks. If you're interested, here's a list of stuff I've done:

Filmed another school play. Made 114 DVDs on an iMac and a MacBook Pro, so very time-consuming.

Was backstage on a recent school production of Romeo and Juliet, which included Dubstep and 600 watt speakers. I am now interested in Dubstep. 

I am now heavily involved in a series of short plays known as "club drama", both lighting and filming.

I have also continued development on [Pickture](http://pickture.me) and my new bookmarking site... as well as updating my personal website, [alexforey.com](http://alexforey.com)

Satisfied? Enough excuses. Proper post coming on Thursday. Goodbye.
