I don't usually blog about small things - but since I updated iCloud control panel in Windows this has popped up:

{% image photostream.png %}

It behaved rather bizarrely, and appears to have a system path of Computer\Photo Stream. No proper file path or anything, it's just appeared. I'm not even sure if it _is _a folder - it might be an empty folder that is filled with not-actual-files by the iCloud Control Panel, and when I copy a file from the folder, it simply downloads it from iCloud.

I'd be interested if anyone could explain how this works.
