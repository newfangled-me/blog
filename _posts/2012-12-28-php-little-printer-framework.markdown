It's what it says on the tin, really - a framework to make making Little Printer publications faster and easier in PHP.

It includes ETag support, as well as automatically generating the meta.json and validate_config endpoints based on the fields you define in config.php.

Get it on [GitHub](https://github.com/alfo/PHP-LittlePrinter).
