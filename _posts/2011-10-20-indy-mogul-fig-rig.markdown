Some of you may know that I love to build things, especially camera gear which would otherwise cost thousands of pounds. The professional Fig Rig is made my Manfrotto, and [you can buy it here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Manfrotto-595B-Fig-Rig/dp/B000LRFURU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1319129001&sr=1-1) if you really want to, although considering how simple the design is, I can't figure out why this is so expensive other than the fact that it has a Manfrotto sticker on it.

Today, I decided to follow the instructions of Indy Mogul's sadly finished internet show, Backyard FX. Here is the video I loosely followed to get my design.



Here in the UK, specific PVC fittings like the ones shown in the video are actually quite hard to come by. Luckily, I found some on ScrewFix, so if anyone out there wants to know where to find them, just search for PVC.

Once I had completed the basic structure, I decided to customize it. After having previous bad experiences with PVC and black spray paint, I decided not to take that option but to simply buy some cheap red electricians tape, and covered all the joints in it to give it a more awesome feel. As I couldn't find any PVC cross-pieces, I modded the design slightly in order to allow me to use another T piece instead.

There are some other cool features, such as the ability to flip the camera upside down in order to get really close to the ground, and I also built mine specifically so I could access the battery and card compartments while the camera was attached to the Fig Rig. To attach my camera to the Fig Rig, I simply drilled a 6mm hole on the opposite wall of the T from the bit that sticks out.

Here is a photo album of various angles of the Fig Rig.

All in all I think this works very well, and when combined with some stabilization from After Effects or the like, creates virtually perfect tracking shots. Again a video, this time of some test footage from my Youtube account, DuckHouseProductions.



All in all, this cost me between £15 and £25 and I am very pleased with the results. If you wanna get some stable shots, no matter what camera you have, I highly recommend investing the time and effort into making one of these.

**UPDATE:** I've since changed it to look like this - a kind of "Redrock Micro" feel. (BTW the camera is for illustration purposes - it shoots on film and therefore can't do video
