I don't have time to tell you the whole story, and it has already been told by many people before, so I will simply provide you with a couple of links that you can look at with your eyeballs. Oh, and one last thing, I think what the Military Wives Choir are doing is excellent, and I hope that they become Christmas number 1 in the UK, and given their only competition is a donkey, I hope that should not be too difficult. 

Anyway - links
