Since BERG finished their transition into being "Cloud services for hardware innovators" (at least for the moment), I've been eagerly awaiting their new prototypes that they've been hinting at for a while.

This, after [FLOCK](http://bergcloud.com/case-studies/flock/), is their next fully fledged internet connected device prototype.

It's obvious that a lot of thought has gone into this, and BERG as a company are exploring how the internet will become part of our everyday lives in a unique way. I'm excited to see what they come up with in the future (and what I'll come up with using my Devshield - I've already got some ideas which I'll post when they're ready for the world).
