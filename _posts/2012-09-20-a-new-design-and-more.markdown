I haven't blogged in quite a while, mainly because I've been so busy. But here I am again, and I thought it was time for a new design.

Film and Stuff was one year old a few days ago, and I thought it was time for a refresh. I went searching through the Wordpress Theme and found this one, which I think suits me quite well.

I've been doing a lot with the [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com) recently and that, along with Markpond and the new school year, has kept be very busy. I'm going to be writing a post very soon in full about both Markpond and Little Printer separately, but you'll have to make do with this for now.

Two more things though - I've recently started actually using GitHub, and I'm rather pleased with my username. It's [alfo](https://github.com/alfo), which must be have been one of the only 4-character usernames left when I signed up last November, but better still it's actually relevant to my name.

And the last thing is that [The Fortrus](http://fortr.us) has been grudgingly resuscitated, and I'm now writing there, as well as here and the [Markpond Blog](http://blog.markpond.com). So if things seem a bit quiet, you can always hop over to one of those to make sure I haven't died yet.

See you soon,

Alex
