Just a quick post - I thought this might amuse some -

[caption id="attachment_92" align="aligncenter" width="382" caption="Umm....."][![Google gives directions to swim across the Pacific Ocean to get from China to Taiwan](http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/google.jpg)](http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/google.jpg)[/caption]

This most likely was put in by someone at Google trying to see if anyone would notice, a bit like the hidden messages about Bill Gates in the spellchecker of Microsoft Word 2003.
