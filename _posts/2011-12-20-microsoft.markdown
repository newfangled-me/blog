But in this fairly lengthy article I intend to demonstrate why I hate Microsoft and their products so very, very much. And not for the obvious reasons, either.

## A Brief Personal History


I will start by giving you s brief history of the computers in my household over the last 10 years. It all started a long time ago, when I was only 7. We had one of these computers. It was super-awesome and we had a dial-up modem, although the only problem with that is I could not get on the internet without my parents noticing because of all the noise that it made when connecting.

[caption id="attachment_299" align="alignleft" width="375" caption="SO RETRO"][![](http://images04.olx.co.za/ui/3/48/53/57054553_1.jpg)](http://images04.olx.co.za/ui/3/48/53/57054553_1.jpg)[/caption]And that was awesome. But then we went round to my cousin's house over Christmas and they had (what looked like) the same computer as ours, but my cousin had this awesome game on it and that was _even more_ awesome (not that the word _awesome_was even around in those days). So eventually I bribed my parents to get it, and upon trying to install it, the computer crashed. Me, having practically no computer knowledge whatsoever, could not help. My Dad tried and tried but to no avail. Time to bring in IT support. They charged an extortionate rate then advised us to get a new computer. Our first computer lasted 2 years, and was only good for Excel Spreadsheets and Word 97. It had something like 128MB of RAM and a CRT display.

Then the second computer. _Yay_. It was some form of HP Pavillion or something and looked a bit like this, and was _shiny_!!. That was thrilling. You could play DVDs on it and stuff. Well, not for long. About 1 year later, whenever you put in a DVD or something similar, it throw up a copyright error or something. Given that it was "_Media Center_" PC, this was not good. On the upside, it had a relatively large HDD (128GB, which was amazing) and a _Flat Screen_. This was also thrilling. It lasted for a while longer. I put too many programs on it, uninstalled them but little did I know that this did not remove the registry values and in the end I think that was the thing that killed it. Bear in mind that I was not as tech-savvy as I am now, and looking back I could have probably fixed quite a lot of things relatively easily. The end came when it got so slow that it took 7 minutes to load iTunes, and even then normally did not recognise my iPod. It could also barely run Word etc... so from the point of view of my Dad this was completely useless. We didn't quite get rid of it yet, because in comes the Sony Vaio _Laptop_. A _Laptop_ you say? Yes, a _laptop_. That was OK and lasted for a while, but by today's standards was fat and clunky and _white_.

But then we got bored with waiting for iTunes to load for 10 minutes and stuff like that. So then we introduced Apple and their computers into our lives, in the form of a 2009 MacBook Pro, which by the way, is still going strong. It's currently running Leopard, but sooner or later we're going to update to Lion, or we might wait for OS X "Minx" or whatever the next one happens to be. This was awesome. I'd previously been to a few Apple stores and blown away by how easy and intuitive their computers, both desktop and laptop. Especially the iMac. Because there was no "box" to speak of - it was "in the screen". And that got me thinking about how computers worked. How could you fit the same amount of stuff in the screen?

Anyway. So after the HP Pavillion monstrosity died and burned, we got an iMac. It was the basic £999 one, but I loved it. This was the end of 2010. It made my life amazing. I had been using Google Docs for quite some time by then, and I no longer had to worry about compatibility issues. I could write something at home, pick it up at school and not have to worry about saving or anything.

And then I got my laptop. I had a very difficult decision when choosing between Mac and Windows. You may think me apolitically stupid for choosing Windows over Mac when given the choice, but I will give you my reasoning. I wanted to do video editing. Why choose Windows? Because I could get a laptop that had a 2.8GHz Quad-Core Processor with 4GBs of RAM for £530. The equivalent MacBook Pro would cost £1600. And School was Windows based. So that was that.


## Recent Experiences


I have had one of the worst possible experiences involving a computer in the last few days. I will say this. For Christmas, Apple is giving me 12 free things from the iTunes store, and one more thing for signing up to get the other free things. On the other hand, Microsoft gave me the present of claiming that my copy of Windows 7 was invalid and not genuine and therefore I had to re-install Windows. Basically my beautiful desktop background was turned black with an overlay of "This copy of Windows is not Genuine". Oh and a f***ing annoying popup every five minutes that automatically launched _Internet Explorer_ with the "Validate Windows Page".

You may ask - why not just change the serial number to the one on the bottom of your laptop? Well I will tell you. Because my laptop was convinced that it was running Ultimate, not Home Premium, which is completely wrong.

So in the end I had move all my 150GB of data to an external HDD which took 13 hours. That should be OK, methinks. But NO, I tell my laptop to copy four folders (Program Files, Program Files (x86), Users and wamp) to my external HDD, but it only copies half of each Program Files Folder and none of the actual contents of the Users folder.

So then I shutdown my computer, took the plunge and completely format my internal HDD. Then I downloaded the Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) SP1 install DVD ISO on the iMac. Then I burnt that to a DVD-R using Disk Utility on the iMac because I didn't trust my laptop to do it.

Finally, after making sure that I wasn't going to do anything that might involve masses of destruction to my important not-backed-up files, I shut down my laptop and went into the BIOS to configure settings so my laptop would boot off a DVD before booting off the hard drive. Then I had to hard-reset my laptop and boot off the DVD. Finally, after much waiting and worrying, a cursor appeared, then finally an installer wizard. (I_ hate _the word _wizard_. It's not even remotely magical.) So I went through it, formatting my hard drive etc... then I clicked on the button of _doom_ - "Install". Surprisingly enough it actually did install and stuff, but for some reason unknown to man it had to restart itself about eight times during the process.

During this whole process I was posting multiple Twitter updates and Instagram Photos. Here they are. (Skip them).

Then finally it finished. I had do go out _into the real world_ for a while to buy Christmas presents so progress stalled for a bit.

Little did I know that the hardest part was still to come. And that problem is that of installing drivers. So when I got back from Westfield, I turned on my newly-reinstalled Laptop. Everything seemed to be going well. I put in a new password etc. and finally got to my new desktop. I thought - now to install a driver for the fingerprint reader, because I _know_ that that won't be included. I was right, but I was more right than I wanted to be. I discovered that Windows had not even detected the fact that I had a wireless LAN adapter installed in my laptop at all. It wasn't in the list of network adapters, so I went into device manager and noticed that I wasn't there either. I was _slightly_ panicking by now. Then I noticed that there was a list of "Unrecognised Devices". I thought well firstly, it's not very out-of-the-ordinary. Why didn't Windows pick it up? Even _Ubuntu_ picked up wireless when it was running off a _DVD_. Well, because it's Windows. And Windows is stupid like that.

Luckily, Windows did detect my Ethernet interface, so I took my laptop down to the hall, where our (feeble excuse for a) router lives. I dug an Ethernet cable out of the basement (because I never use Ethernet... more about that in a future post), and plugged it straight in.

The first thing I did (oddly) was to go and find the driver for my fingerprint reader. Why I hear you (well I can't actually hear you, but you know what I mean) cry. Surely you have more important things to be worried about? Well... meh. So I searched through a couple of HP forum posts and finally found the one I was looking for. Downloaded, Installed, Restarted, setup. OK. That was fixed.

Next problem - Wireless. But I thought hang on... there's this annoying thing popping up and down so I clicked on it and low and behold - there were 73 updates waiting for me - one of which was a Broadcom Driver. That was hopefully what I wanted.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="612" caption="73 Updates. Fun."][![](https://instagr.am/p/aGZf5/media/?size=l)](https://instagr.am/p/aGZf5/media/?size=l)[/caption]

And then there was one last thing to do to fix stuff - restart. So I restart and this happened....

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="612" caption="OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD"][![](https://instagr.am/p/aGxD9/media/?size=l)](https://instagr.am/p/aGxD9/media/?size=l)[/caption]

Namely, it automatically started up in Safe Mode and crashed when it finished loading the Windows files. So again I hard reset and it decides to work again, but starting in Normal Mode this time. And then another problem happened... this.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="612" caption="Why, I hate you too, laptop."][![](https://instagr.am/p/aG5c6/media/?size=l)](https://instagr.am/p/aG5c6/media/?size=l)[/caption]

One of the updates had been for my graphics card (which by the way had also been labelled as Generic, which it most certainly isn't) and had convinced itself that my screen was 600px x 600px. Not a smart move. So again, I restarted the computer in the hope that it would fix itself. Which, luckily, it did.

AND THEN, *sigh* I had to go about re-installing my programs. Of which there are many. But I had a thought - how many of those programs do I actually need? Well... about 50 out of the 264 previously installed. So I went about downloading them, and for future reference I made a list with the direct download links of my favourite programs on my website with my iPhone at this address - [alexforey.com/programs](http://alexforey.com/programs).

One final thing I did was to partition my hard-drive into two pieces - an OS partition (C:) and a data partition (D:), so that if this ever happened again I wouldn't have to worry about shipping 150GB of data around via USB2. Which is not fun.


## Microsoft vs Apple


I go back to the idea of the Christmas presents given by Microsoft and Apple. One a 16.5 hour re-install, that would have petrified the average Joe and sent him running for a useless Microsoft tech support; the other some free stuff (that I will probably actually want) from their online store of music, movies, apps and TV shows. Which one would you prefer?

In the past, things were different. Around the time that we got our first computer, this was the general opinion.



But nowadays I feel that the general opinion has completely changed. This reflects more the origins of the two companies. Both Microsoft and Apple started out as "two guys in a garage", but (as far as I can tell) Microsoft was always supposed to be a _big_ business, whereas Apple was just making computer for Steve Jobs' and Steve Wozniak's friends. There's another video coming up in a moment (which you really should have already seen), made by the BBC about Steve Jobs' life. And one thing that struck me was the fact that Bill Gates was working with Steve Jobs for a while, and just before the release of the Apple II (the first computer to use icons), he went off and released his own one a few weeks before the release of the Apple II. And I don't think Steve Jobs ever forgave him for that (judging by his character I find this hardly surprising).

Anyway - here it is.




## The Bottom Line


Well I think that this is it - I would never, _ever_ expect a new MacBook Pro, Air or iMac to have to re-install OS X because Apple disabled it. Apple seems to take the view (with practically all their software) that because you have it, you must have bought it. There is no serial number system on Snow Leopard or Lion, or Final Cut Pro X or Aperture. Apple trusts you. _Sure_, there will be people who download it illegally, but Apple is willing to let them be. It doesn't cost them anything.

But on the other hand, Microsoft validates _all_ their products with online servers because they do not trust anyone. And people get round that system. It is said that somewhere between 35% - 45% of all copies of Windows are pirated by some means or another. On the other hand OS X has only got a rate of 5 - 15%. The reason? Apple goes out of their way to make it easy to buy their products. Most people pirate not because they can't afford it, but because it's actually easier than buying it.

To upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion requires about five clicks - open Mac App Store, search for Lion, Install, Sign In, Confirm. That's it. I've done it myself. But to upgrade from Vista to 7, you have to physically buy a disk (or a serial number), put it in your computer, launch the installer, click through about eight screens of copyright crap, put in your serial number which is like 32 characters long and then wait about eight hours for it to complete. Most people can't be bothered to get out their credit card etc. and type in all the fiddly numbers to a Microsoft website that _deliberately_ only works in _Internet Explorer_ or to actually go to a real shop.

Because, in reality, it's easier to go to the Pirate Bay, download a cracked or otherwise version and burn it to a disc and slam it back into your computer. I put it to you, and I leave it to you.

Merry Christmas.

See you soon (-ish, and that's only if I'm not swamped in Christmas Homework), Alex.

**UPDATE: **A few weeks after I reinstalled Windows 7, I got a message saying I needed to "Activate Windows". I was apprehensive, but it said all I needed to do was call them. So I did. Here was the screen I got -

[![](http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/update11.png)](http://newfangled.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/update11.png) In total I had to type in 54 numbers into my phone, then it sent another 54 numbers back by text which I then had to type into little text boxes. I can't imagine Apple doing this to me. They know that people hate long fiddly numbers. But after that everything worked again. And hopefully it will be until I go over to Mac Laptops.
