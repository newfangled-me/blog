I think it would be fair to say that the world was shaken today by the death of Apple's founder, Steve Jobs. This was entirely unexpected - people knew he was ill, seriously ill, but the general idea was that he was in a stable condition.

Steve Jobs could have been one of the most successful and busy men the earth has seen today. He co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Through his time at Apple, it is possible to say that he was one of the great master-minds behind nearly every single product, from the G2 way back in the day to the iPhone 4 (but sadly not the 4S). That means that he had a major role in developing pretty much everything that you could walk into an Apple shop and see, and everything on their website. This man had a very active life, so one might have thought that he would pull through better than he did, but you never know.

In 1986, after being effectively kicked out of Apple, Steve Jobs buys PIXAR, the computer animation company behind titles such as the Toy Story series, Flushed Away and many others. He revolutionized it and lead it to a state where he could successfully sell it to Disney, at a great profit. At this point, he returned to Apple and completely revolutionized that too - he brought Apple to the state it is in today, with some of the most innovative and imaginative and ultimately useful pieces of technology around at any time. He thought up the idea of putting the letter 'i' before devices, to suggest integration with the internet, but now they have evolved into so much more - the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. These devices have revolutionized the world we live in today, and for that we should remember him as one of the pioneers of technology.

Here is an interesting video, made by ABC News, remembering Steve Jobs.

On a final note, Apple has just published [a page on their website ](http://http://www.apple.com/uk/stevejobs/) to demonstrate how much he meant to all the people at Apple, and if you want to pay your respects, you can send Apple an email at [rememberingsteve@apple.com](mailto:rememberingsteve@apple.com).
