Here's a list of reasons why not:



	
  1. I have two memory cards. One of them works with Raspberry Pis, and one that doesn't. So I (still) can't use my second Raspberry Pi.

	
  2. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with them. After I installed Plex Media Server on [my main server](http://filmandstuff.co.uk/475-diy-home-server), I wanted to install Raspbmc; but I ran into problems, again. For some reason, RC1 and RC2 wouldn't work.

	
  3. Then [Raspbmc.com](http://raspbmc.com) went down for ages and ages. In fact it only [came back up](http://www.raspbmc.com/2012/07/welcome-back/) three days ago. And so I couldn't test out RC3, and I've decided to wait until official release anyway, so I get a stable version.

	
  4. Then I was making a film, and I'll write about that soon. I've  nearly finished _arranging the footage in the timeline_ after a whole week of editing. Considering we filmed an average of five takes per shot, and there were _a lot of shots_.


And then I started my week of internship at [Firefly Solutions](http://fireflysolutions.co.uk) in Hammersmith. Everyone there was very nice and welcoming, and I really felt at home there. But the long and the short of it was that I needed a mini testing server, and decided that the Raspberry Pi fitted the bill perfectly. So I installed Apache2 and PHP so I could do dynamic pages, and set it to log in automatically and start itself up as soon as power is plugged in.

That means I can find a spare ethernet port, plug it in, and then do an IP scan from my laptop, find its IP address, and then FTP all the files to it. Of course, I do actually already have WAMP on my laptop, but this is _way more cool_.

I'm not entirely sure if I'm allowed to talk about what I actually did at Firefly, and so I won't, but it was very interesting. But one cool thing I saw there were MASSIVE sticky notes. And so now I have some. And so now I will use them.

I've got a lot of projects entering their final stages now, so prepare for a flood of posts as they get completed and I get round to documenting them.

Until then, see you on the interwebs.
