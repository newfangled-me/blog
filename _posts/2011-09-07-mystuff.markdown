Hello All.

For anyone interested - here are some links to recent projects. (Most of them are heavily intermingled with Duck House Productions, my small yet awesome production company that was founded before the MPs' expenses.



	
  1. The Hacker - [http://vimeo.com/duckhouse/thehacker](http://vimeo.com/duckhouse/thehacker)

	
  2. The Showreel - http://... actually you can just go check out all my short films at [http://www.duckhouseproductions.co.uk/short-films](http://www.duckhouseproductions.co.uk/short-films)

	
  3. The Salamander Suite - good for the everyday computer - [http://duckhouse.weebly.com/salamander-suite.html](http://duckhouse.weebly.com/salamander-suite.html)

That is all
