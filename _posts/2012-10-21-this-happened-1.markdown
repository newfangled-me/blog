I probably should have written about this before, but I guess I'm disorganised like that.

Way back in May (does't that feel like a long time ago(!)) I filmed the series of "[This Happened](http://www.thishappened.org/events/london-12)" talks at the V&A for the lovely [Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino](http://designswarm.com) - and just recently (as far as I know) they've been released.

Here they are, in order:

{% vimeo 49791007 %}

{% vimeo 49852474 %}

{% vimeo 49852475 %}

{% vimeo 49852476 %}

If there's one thing that I wasn't satisfied by it was the sound, and I managed to fix this issue when I filmed the next set ([London #13](http://www.thishappened.org/events/london-13)) with the use of [David Smith](http://preoccupations.org)'s amazing radio microphone. I've just finished editing those talks, and I'll post them here when they go online.
