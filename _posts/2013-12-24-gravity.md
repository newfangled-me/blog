I was hoping for something a little more in-depth, and that's probably coming, but for now this 5 minute video gives us a peek into how Gravity was made.

A lot of super-awesome motion control rigs and lighting simulation. They make lifting heavy cameras and actors look effortless, which - considering how powerful they are - is hardly surprising, and a little bit terrifying.
