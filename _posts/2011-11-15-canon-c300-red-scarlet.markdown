So. So, so so. Canon announced the C300 and ... I'm assuming you know what that is. Let me explain further.

The Canon C300 is a Cinema Motion Picture camera. It costs $20,000. It is not cheap. It has an EF and a PL lens mount, so you can use a crapton of lenses on it. With the release of the C300, Canon also released several new lenses, such as the Cinema 30-300mm EF lens. It looks like this.

Well - now you have all the knowledge you could possible need about that - on to the Red Epic. I mean Scarlet. Something else I must explain.

Originally, in around 2009, the whole idea behind the Red Scarlet was that it would be the affordable on the Red Beasts. It was intended to be around $2,500-ish and it was gonna be awesome! For the same price as a DSLR, you could have a proper motion picture camera that would have all the features you'd expect and it would shoot at 3K! Sadly, only fixed lenses, but I'm sure they could have come up with something. This beast would have looked like this. I would have by all means bought one of these over a 5D mkII or a 7D.

But oh no. Red recently announced the official new Red Scarlet. It is basically a smaller version of the Red Epic, with less epic features (like only FPS up to 60 and only 4K resolution). On the upside you can have interchangeable lenses - so if you just happen to have a Red Epic or a [Red One](http://www.red.com/products/red-one) lying about - you could use those lenses instead - or you can buy a mount that allows you to attach any Canon lens to it for a mere $500.

But I still haven't told you about the real problem with this new Scarlet. The price. At $10,000 - it's not cheap. But if you buy only the 'brain' as they call it (the rest of the world calls that a body) - it's best and only use is as a paperweight. Why you ask me? Because after buying that - you also need to buy the LCD screen ($1,600), the battery ($500), the Red Mag (the only thing these cameras can record onto - $1,800), Red Station (the only way of getting this footage onto a computer - $250), some batteries ($515), side grip (for handheld - $950) and the list goes ON and ON and ON... But it does look cool:

The bottom line is - to buy a functional Red Scarlet - you have to have around $16,000. Not so appealing any more. Ryan Connolly from Film Riot had some different thoughts on these cameras - which you can take a gander at.



Of course, I have never actually touched any of these in real life - I'm basically going of spec sheets, but I leave you with one thought.

Are these cameras really 5 times better than a Canon 5D mkII given they cost at least 5 times the price?

Alex, signing off.
