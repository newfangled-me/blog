Well... no it didn't work. It installed alright, rebooted fine, but when I come to the page on the first boot cycle that says 'Already have a mac?' I click no, then it freezes. It gets completely stuck. So I go along to this [forum page here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=97935) and try to boot in single user mode, but then when it comes to that part while booting, it doesn't give me a chance to press F8 to enter boot parameters. So now I'm trying back with a new bootloader: Darwin_snow_legacy.

Will report back soon, Alex signing off.
