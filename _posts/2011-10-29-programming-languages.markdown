![](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo_512.png)A slightly off-topic post - this blog is meant to be about Film after all...

There are many, many different programming languages out there, and they all have different uses. I will cover some of the main ones, because I can't be bothered to do all of them.


#### HTML


Perhaps the most fundamental and easiest of programming languages. Every single web page on the internet is using some form of HTML when it displays content out to the user. This blog is using HTML to display text, and it has LOADS of basic tags, such as <p>, <br> and <img> and some more, and some more. HTML code is sent to the browser and is then rendered by the browser for you to see. Different browsers render this differently, as you can see if you read [this article](http://filmandstuff.co.uk/2011/09/browsers/) on browsers. Relatively recently, HTML5 was released with a whole load of awesome features, and you can see a summary of those new features


#### JavaScript


Not to be confused with Java, this is code run in the browser on triggers sent by the user or the DOM: meaning you can run a function to do something when the page is ready or when you press a button (or similar). JavaScript is mostly used for clever programming, like figuring out statistics every time you change a number in a box or something. Did you know that Google Analytics relies on JavaScript, as every time someone loads a page with a tracking code on it, the little piece of code that you paste into your page sends a web request to an engine in Google that receives a whole load of data about you.

jQuery which runs on JavaScript is awesome, and allows you to do so many cool things in a way that makes you think "that's how the web should work". Go do some more research if you don't know what it can do.

There are also some problems with JavaScript, such as the fact that it can be switched off by the user. This can be fatal if using it as a spam filter, or as form validation. People have had servers crashed by spammers getting past JavaScript - so be warned.


#### CSS


This is what is known as the styling of the web. CSS allows you to completely change the way a page looks without changing any HTML. Entire blogs have been created specifically about CSS, including [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com), and empowers the web to look awesome. If you want to make anything on the web, GO LEARN CSS. It's also rendered in the browser, so really old web browsers won't support the latest CSS3 features.


#### PHP


PHP is a server language, and therefore no matter what browser/computer you have, this language will not change. What does matter though, is having PHP installed on your server. This makes a difference because PHP is processed on the server every time you make a request, even before the page is sent to the browser. This blog runs on PHP, and because what you are actually looking at is some text that has been pulled from a database, when you send the request for this page, PHP figures out what you're looking for, gets it from the database, and then sends it to your browser. That means that PHP itself does not change no matter what device you view it on. A very interesting language, I would recommend adding this to your programming tool-belt.


#### VB.NET


This is one of Microsoft's languages, that runs from the .NET Framework. Don't ask me how it works, if you're interested you can go look it up. VB.NET is used to make desktop programs, such as my Scribe, which is currently on the brink of release. Unlike the rest of these languages, you have to download a program to make programs, instead of using a regular text editor. There are other similar programming languages that run on the same framework such as C#.NET and F#.NET, but I won't go into those. Once you have finished making a program, you have to build it for release, then you can save it as a ZIP and ship it for people to download. Before anyone can run your program, they have to have the relevant version of the .NET Framework running on their machine.

I have written 722 words so far, and it's getting late, and I'm getting bored. After all, programming is like an off-hobby for me. Good night.
