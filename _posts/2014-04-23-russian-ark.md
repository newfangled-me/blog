I stumbled across *In One Breath* recently, a film about the making of *Russian Ark*, a one-shot 96-minute masterpiece covering several centuries of Russian history set in the Winter Pallace in St. Petersberg. It's an amazing feat of cinema with appearances from over 2,000 actors all in period costume and 3 orchestras only a single night of filming.

The full film, shot on video to keep the load down on the Steadicam and to increase recording time, is available on YouTube for your viewing pleasure (although probably not for much longer...):

The behind the scenes film, in 5 parts, and well worth a watch too, and it covers various aspects of the difficulties of shooting a feature film in 36 hours, which was the amount of time they had before they were kicked out of the museum.
