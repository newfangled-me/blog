Wow. OK. Here goes.

(Not that much) earlier today, Apple kinda unofficially announced Mac OS X Mountain Lion, although nowadays they seem to have dropped the "Mac" bit, assuming that everyone already knows what it is, and so they now refer to is as simply "OS X".

I'm not going to bother going through all the new features, because you could just [hop over to Apple's official page](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/) which details them much better then I ever could.

However, I did notice that there is a link to that page on the Apple US Homepage (apple.com), but there is not one on the Apple UK page (apple.com/uk). I'm not quite sure why not, maybe they're busy translating their US page into proper English.

Anyway, on with the show. Basically, Apple are taking all are most loved features from iOS (notification centre, iMessage, Reminders, Notes, and Game Center - notice spelled the wrong way), and putting them into OS X. Not a bad move, unlike what [Microsoft did](http://filmandstuff.co.uk/204-windows8), which was the other way round.

This is big in it's own way, and I'll be interested to see how well it works. The advance of iMessage is just another step in the direction of blowing BBM and RIM out of the water completely. Which I think is a good thing, for reasons I may outline in a future post.

This is all very well and good, but there is something more which interested me. Finally, it appears that Apple have started to properly integrate iCloud into the heart of OS X. This might well [blow Dropbox out of the water](http://t.co/7Y7hRZ4c) as well. Well, isn't Apple doing well for themselves with this update? There are going to be two completely different "Finders", one "On my Mac" and one "iCloud", although again this is all still speculation.

I am generally staggered by the speed that Apple can produce these operating systems, and as they outline in [this video](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#video-mountainlion), it will be less than a year between the release of Lion and Mountain Lion. Microsoft could not even compete with this speed, and the predicted release date for Windows 8 means it will have been three years between Windows 8 and Windows 7, and as I mentioned in [my Windows 8 review](http://filmandstuff.co.uk/204-windows8), there actually doesn't appear to be much difference at all between the two. So what have Microsoft been doing for three years? Designing the new start screen, apparently.

See you soon,

Alex.
