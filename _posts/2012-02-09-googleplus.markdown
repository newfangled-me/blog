title: Why Google Plus is called Google Plus

Just a quick post - I have a meatier one coming soon, but I'm preparing for a film shoot tomorrow.

During a recent ICT lesson about how Google intend to move towards completely personalized searches, a new way that Google intends to use your data was mentioned: Google Plus will boost results on search pages based on what people in your Google Plus circles have recently viewed. This comes with a lot of other changes Google have made regarding privacy and use of data.

But that got me thinking - what's in the name "Plus". It doesn't suggest a social network (although to be fair, most of the names of _popular_ social networks don't _really_ suggest that either). It suggests an extension of Google, a better Google. Maybe that's what Google Plus was always meant to be.

Perhaps Google's being particularly crafty - their previous "social networks" failed because they were trying to compete with the likes of Facebook, which (currently) has around 850 million users. No chance. But this time it is different - Google are trying to offer this as a way of enjoying stuff with your friends, AND enhance your everyday search experience.

Hmm... clever. Google Plus being an extension of the Google search engine, rather than just another failed social network. Good thinking.

That's what people used to think of Google as being - their eyes set on sights that were fundamentally beyond what the company was created to do. But think of this scenario - my friend showed me this link a while ago. He can't remember it, I can't remember it. He remembered that he searched for it, though. So that's OK. So all I have to do is make sure that I communicate with him fairly frequently on Google Plus. That way I can use more vague search terms (or less precise, depending on what floats your boat), and still find what I'm looking for. This is a good idea, as long as you trust an internet Giant like Google with your [browser history](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/02/google-paying-users-to-track-100-of-their-web-usage-via-little-black-box.ars). Which I don't.

Think about that. Just a little theory of mine.

Alex, signing off.

PS - I'm particularly annoyed about Google at the moment, aren't I?
